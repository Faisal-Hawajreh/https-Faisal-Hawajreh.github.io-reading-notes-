# Unit tests and TDD?
"Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output, and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want. But Test-Driven Development is a strategy to think (and write!) tests first."

## The cycle is made by three steps:

" Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isn’t there, right? If this test passes, call the Ghostbusters, really)"
 "Write the feature and make the test pass! "
 "Refactor the code — the first version doesn’t need to be the beautiful one."

## What does the if __name__ == “__main__”: do?
"Before executing code, Python interpreter reads source file and define few special variables/global variables. 
If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value “__main__”. If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module’s name. Module’s name is available as value to __name__ global variable."

## What is Recursion? 
"The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily."
