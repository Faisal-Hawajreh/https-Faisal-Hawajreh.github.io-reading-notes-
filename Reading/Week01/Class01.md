Pain vs. Suffering

To reach our goals, we will bear the pain...
"That price is pain, the pain of growth."
"Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm."

"Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used by an algorithm."

The graphs will help us to imagine how the output will be. especially the (log N: log 10, log 100 ...)

O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute at the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.

O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2^N) function is exponential — starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically.

This type of algorithm is described as O(log N). The iterative halving of data sets described in the binary search example produces a growth curve that peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size of the data sets increase e.g. an input data set containing 10 items takes one second to complete, a data set containing 100 items takes two seconds, and a data set containing 1,000 items will take three seconds.
